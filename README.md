This repository contains the undergraduate thesis titled “*Dynamical Systems and Scalar Fields in Cosmology*” alongside several Mathematica files that support the research. The thesis is divided into three main parts: the first provides the theoretical background in dynamical systems and cosmology, the second focuses on the application of dynamical systems theory to cosmological models, while the last presents a numerical solution and detailed study of the behavior of quintessence and phantom fields evolving under a step-like potential.

The Mathematica files included in this repository cover three key areas: the implementation of dynamical systems analysis to assess the stability and evolution of cosmological models with scalar fields, numerical solutions that demonstrate the dynamics of quintessence and phantom fields in the presence of a step-like potential, and statistical fitting procedures that compare observational data to both the standard $\Lambda$&#8203;CDM model and the phantom field model with a $\tanh$ potential.
